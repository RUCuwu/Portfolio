  In my portfolio, I used React to create different components like the NavBar and the pages you

can explore. Using React I made buttons that are functional and link to various resources, the

contact page is fully functional as well and you can input data to contact me on pricing for web

designs. The Project page uses react functions to power the pricing buttons and dynamically

show projects on my project page as well as my home page.
